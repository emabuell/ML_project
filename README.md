# ML_project
Project for machine and deep learning course

In this short project I investigated noise robustness and the effect of some transformation group invariance priors on a benchmark architecture in the context of audio classification.
In particular, invariance comes from a human's prior knowledge about groups of transformations for which we would like our classifier to be invariant about, like time translations, time dilations or other transformations in the Mel-frequency's feature space. These invariances are often enforced through data augmentation approaches, that often have also an interesting effect on the metrics of the classifier itself.
